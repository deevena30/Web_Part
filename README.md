1. For the web part of the assignment I have completed First two questions ( event card design and Debug and improve ).
2. There is one HTML page that is code of event card design and a folder called "docs" in that there is one pdf file which contains the issues of the website and a html page which contains the code of the fixed issue.I have to name it as "docs" since I can't find a way to deploy it if I give it name as "fixes" (My github pages, it is showing docs as the root directory for deployment )
3. here is link for the Repo "https://github.com/deevena30/Web_Part.git"
